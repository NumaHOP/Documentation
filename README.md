# Numahop technical documentation. 

## Generated documentation.
Some part of the documentation is generated and needs a Numahop Installation to the version for which you want to generate the documentation.
In the `scripts` folder there are the scripts used to update the generated part of the documentation.
In the `gen` folder there are the cached generated documentation pieces allowing to build for the latest NumaHOP release.

## Dependencies

coreutils
```
