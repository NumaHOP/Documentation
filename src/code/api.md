# API auto documentation.

> Note: The open-api auto documentation is incorect because NumaHOP doesn't respect the open-api specification causing some handlers to be merged into one in the documentation. This will be fixed when the api is redesigned see [#8](https://github.com/biblibre/NumaHOP-code/issues/8).
